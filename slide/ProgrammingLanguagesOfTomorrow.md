## TIOBE index

The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the number of skilled engineers worldwide, courses and third-party vendors. Popular search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo!, Wikipedia, Amazon, YouTube and Baidu are used to calculate the ratings. It is important to note that the TIOBE index is not about the best programming language or the language in which most lines of code have been written.

## Remoteok - conclusion?

Ruby appears to be the highest paid language and PHP the lowest paid, but let's not be distracted by these data: the difference is only 10%.
Why is the difference so low? Maybe because job postings are now tending to include many cross-functional skills?
